<h1>All time favorite movies of Sudhanshu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 genres </h2>
<hr/>
<h3>  Action (Top 3)</h3>
   <h4> Top gun:-</h4>
    <p>One of the best movies of Tom Cruise and mine too,<br/>
    the movie tells the story of hot shot pilot maverick
    </p>
    <h4> The Beekeeper:-</h4>
    <p>The Beekeeper is one of the best"one man fights the system"<br/>
    action entries in recent memory.
    </p>
    <h4> Rebel Moon:-</h4>
    <p>Zack Snyders latest sci-fi epic,Rebel moon, with the directors <br/>
   signature bombastic visuals and operatic storytelling
    </p>
    
    <hr/>
   
    <h3> Horror (Top 3)</h3> 
    <h4>Shutter:-</h4>
    <p>A spine tingling thriller, it is a horror thriller that skillfully<br/>
    intertwines suspense,supernatural elements.
    </p>
    <h4> Zodiac:-</h4>
    <p>Absolute classic, if you have researched the Zodiac killer you will<br/>
     know how close this is to the real storyline/Robert Graysmiths book and<br/>
      how well David Fincher has replicated this harrowing real life take on a<br/>
       psychotic, intelligent serial killer and the detectives determined to catch him.</p>
    <h4>  Wrong Turn:-</h4>
     <p>I watched this film with a negative outlook seeing as to how the<br/>
         Wrong Turn sequels have become after the second installment.<br/>
          The Trailer didn't really help much either since it took the very restrained<br/>
           route so as to not show any key plots in the film.
        </p>
     <hr/>
     <h3>Drama (Top 3)</h3>
     <h4>  12th fail:-</h4>
     <p>"12 Failures" is undeniably one of the most captivating and thought-provoking<br/>
         movies ever made, transcending the boundaries of conventional storytelling<br/>
          to deliver a powerful and resonant cinematic experience. The film's brilliance<br/>
           lies not only in its compelling narrative but also in its exceptional character<br/>
            development and masterful direction.
    </p>
     <h4>  American Psycho:-</h4>
     <p>My favourite movie of all time, so exquisite! I love everything about this film<br/>
         especially the fact it takes place in New York. The costumes are perfect,<br/>
          Ioved Christians   role as Patrick Bateman.
        </p>
     <h4>  Poor Things:-</h4>
     <p> It is based on the 1922 novel of the same name and offering a modern twist<br/>
         on the classic Frankenstein tale, Poor Things is a visual concoction of<br/>
          Tim Burton's imagination of oddities, Wes Anderson's quirky characters,<br/>
           and Guillermo Del Toro's gothic fairy tale ambiance.</p>
